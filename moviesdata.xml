By tradition, she is unceremoniously left at a bare and impoverished widows' ashram, beside the Ganges during monsoon season. The ashram's leader pimps out Kalyani, a young and beautiful widow, for household funds. Narayan, a follower of Gandhi, falls in love with her. Can she break with tradition and religious teaching to marry him? The ashram's moral center is Shakuntala, deeply religious but conflicted about her fate. Can she protect Kalyani or Chuyia? Amid all this water, is rebirth possible or does tradition drown all?</Data></Cell>

    <Cell><Data ss:Type="String">When a young rabbit named Fiver (Richard Briers) has a prophetic vision that the end of his warren is near, he persuades seven other rabbits to leave with him in search of a new home. Several obstacles impede their progress, including predators, a rat-filled cemetery and a speeding river. Upon arriving at their final destination, a hill dubbed Watership Down, the rabbits find that their journey is still far from over. </Data></Cell>
    <Cell><Data ss:Type="String">Underneath a small patch of land cloaked in tall grass somewhere in a dark warren of the lush English countryside, Fiver, a skittish prescient rabbit&#45;-having shared his hauntingly vivid nightmares of destruction with his brother, Hazel&#45;-instigates a mass exodus in search of a safe new home. However, the journey to greener pastures is as long as it is precarious, entangling the audacious furry settlers in an endless string of shockingly unknown and devastating perils, which include not only voracious predators but also betrayal and the mighty weapons of men. Is this the future the Lapine pilgrims have been dreaming of at the promised Watership Down Hill, especially when the ghastly warren chief, General Woundwort, awaits at the end of the line?</Data></Cell>
